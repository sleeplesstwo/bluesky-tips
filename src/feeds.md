# What is a Feed?

At is most basic a feed is simply a collection of posts that is created via a set of rules.  These rules can be as simple as "All posts with the word art" to as complicated as something like "Get all posts with images, run each image through a machine learning moddel to determine if there is a cat in the picture and if so add it to the feed"

# Creating a Feed

There are a couple services which will help you with creating and hosting your feed.

* [Skyfeed](https://skyfeed.app/)
* [Bluesky Feed Creator](https://blueskyfeedcreator.com/)

Both are good options this example will use Skyfeed as the free tier of Bluesky Feed Creator only retains the last 100 posts, however if you are running a bigger feed and want to see stats like how many views it gets or how many posts per day match it Bluesky Feed Creator can provide that.  The first feed we will be creating is one I've repeatedly seen interest in from artists which is a feed of their own art posts.
